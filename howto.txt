On phone: use the top left arrow to get to the recovery main menu
On phone: Go to Apply update > Apply from ADB (the phone will wait for input from your desktop via the cable then)
On desktop: ensure the Lineage zip file is really 100% downloaded (we do not want to flash an unfinished download!)
On desktop: type "adb -d sideload {filename of Lineage zip file}" (do not reboot or pull the cable while flashing!)
On desktop: relax and breathe! In my case the upload stopped at 47% and it took a about two minutes until the phone showed the menu. This is normal!
On phone: confirm no addons by selecting "No"
On phone: in the following menu select "Reboot system now"
On phone: wrestle yourself through the initial setup process until the LineageOS home screen appears

# unfortunately, it's not possible to relock your bootloader with LineageOS (which is a security breach)
# even though booting into real fastboot mode by typing "fastboot reboot fastboot" on your desktop device (needs sudo on *ux)
# and checking by "fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability", receiving a "1" you will not be able to relock your bootloader,
# according to https://forum.fairphone.com/t/relock-bootloader-step-by-step/98339/8
